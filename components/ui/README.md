# UI Components (Atoms)

This directory contains atomic UI components following the design system from `flow-design-spec.pdf`.

## Components to implement (Priority 2):

- Button
- Input

Each component should:
- Use design tokens from Tailwind config
- Be mobile-first responsive
- Follow the component example in `.cursorrules`
- Match exact spacing/colors from design spec
